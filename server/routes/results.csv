  "company_name": "General Electric (GE)",
  "analysis": {
    "mission_statement": "The provided text doesn't explicitly state a single, overarching mission statement for the parent company, General Electric.  However, the individual statements for each of its spin-off companies offer insight into the overall GE ethos.  GE Aerospace's implicit mission is to lead in aviation technology; GE Vernova's is to generate clean energy; and GE HealthCare's is to improve patient outcomes.  Therefore, I infer that GE's former overarching mission was likely focused on technological innovation and improving quality of life across various sectors.",
    "products_and_services": "Prior to its restructuring, GE offered a broad range of products and services spanning aviation, energy, and healthcare.  Now, these sectors are represented by three independent companies:  \n* **GE Aerospace:**  Provides aircraft engines, avionics, and other aviation technologies. \n* **GE Vernova:** Focuses on renewable energy technologies, including wind turbines and gas turbines. \n* **GE HealthCare:**  Develops and manufactures medical imaging equipment, patient monitoring systems, and other healthcare technologies.",
    "founding_date_and_founders": "General Electric was founded in 1892 by Thomas Edison.  While the original company is no longer structured in the same way, the history and legacy remain linked to the three current companies.",
    "headquarters_location": "While the precise location is not specified in the data, General Electric's headquarters historically has been in Boston, MA.  Since the spinoffs, it's important to note that each of the three companies would have its own separate headquarters.",
    "key_executives": "The provided text lacks information on the current leadership teams for each of the spinoff companies. To gain a complete picture of the key executives, one would need to visit each of their individual websites.",
    "awards_and_recognitions": "The provided text does not mention specific awards.  However, given GE's history as a major global corporation, it has undoubtedly received numerous awards and recognitions over its lifetime.  Information on this would require searching external resources and each of the independent companies' websites."
